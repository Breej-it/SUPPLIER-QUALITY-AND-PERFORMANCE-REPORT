# POWER BI
In collaboration with S & L Manufacturers Ltd., I undertook a critical analysis of supplier quality to address significant challenges stemming from the absence of a centralized procurement system. The lack of consistency across various plants resulted in difficulties validating supplier performance and material quality, leading to operational inefficiencies.

By consolidating data from multiple sources, I identified key metrics related to material defects and vendor performance. The analysis revealed specific vendors responsible for the highest defect rates and highlighted the plants contributing most to operational downtime. Additionally, I examined the interactions between materials and vendors to uncover combinations that performed poorly.

Utilizing Power BI for data visualization, I provided actionable insights that informed strategic decisions, including recommendations for establishing a centralized procurement system and implementing regular supplier performance reviews. This project not only improved the understanding of supplier quality but also laid the groundwork for enhanced operational efficiency and cost reduction within the organization.

The report has 6 pages, with each one showing different metrics.

# INSIGHTS
1. Yombu, Avamm and Meejo are the top three Vendors causing the greatest defect quantity.
2. Riverside, Charles City and Twin Rocks are the top three Plant Locations causing the greatest downtime.
3. A particular combination of material and vendor that perform poorly is Edgeblab's Raw Materials.
4. A particular combination of vendor and  plant that perform poorly is Wikido's Plant Location.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
1. A thorough investigation of these Vendors and Plant Locations is necessary to discover the reasons behind these defect quantities and downtime.
2. Implement a plan of action based on the findings of the investigation.
3. For the Edgeblab combination as well as the Wikido combination, alternative vendors, plants and materials that can meet quality standards should be explored. This may involve pilot testing new suppliers, plant locations or materials to ensure performance. More also, supplier base and plant locations should be diversified for critical materials to reduce dependency on underperforming vendors and locations. This can enhance resilience in the supply chain.
